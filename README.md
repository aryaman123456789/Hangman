If the player surpasses the given amount of tries, the player loses and the secret word is revealed.

## Learnings

Throughout the development of this Hangman game in C, I gained a multitude of insights and experiences:

1. **Problem Solving**: Debugging and resolving issues in the code significantly improved my problem-solving skills. It taught me how to approach a problem, break it down, and find a solution.

2. **Understanding of C Programming**: This project deepened my understanding of C programming concepts such as arrays, loops, and functions. I learned how to use these concepts to build a functional game.

3. **Efficiency**: I learned the importance of writing efficient code and organizing the script using different sections for easy readability and maintenance, which will be crucial for large-scale projects in the future.
